# CLPY app

A clipboard for handling links from the web. 

## V1

Focus on the Hold/Push stage of the task continuity cycle, give users an experience that allows them to quickly share, dismiss, or snooze items on their clipboard.

## V2 (for later)

Expand scope to add support for more Movie sites (Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, etc), include more types of links (not just Movies?), add a "Discover Mode" for related content, show suggestions (who else reviewed this? what else would I be interested in?), and others.
